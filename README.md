# CS120-Final
My final project game

It was pretty fun, stressful, but loads of fun when I was making this game.
The original goal that I had on my game doc was that I would have a red and a blue player and two colors of coins in which only red could take a specific colored coin and the same for blue. 
I would have also planned on having boosters like x2 points, guns, etc..
I could only get to work on having one colored coin and have it based on whoever can collect the most coins before the time ends or when all the coins have been collected. I also got a speed booster alongside a silver coin that gave you 2 points to your score.

The instructions can be found when you click on the 'Description' button in the starting menu. What is not stated in that screen is that if you bump into your opposition close enough to the boundaries, you could potentially get them stuck and have the coins all to yourself. Also the big silver coins are worth 2 points. 

I used the basic import random for the computer to generate a random int which dictated how much boosters and coins would be spawned on the map. I also had a sprite for basically everything you see on the screen. 

A external resource that I used would include stack overflow where I learned a lot of codes that helped me make this and ultimately taught me loads of things. I also used the external resources provided by Prof. Harris such as OpenGameArt and ClipArt. 

What I did was that I would have certain goals to reach before the day ended, just like what Prof. Harris had for us in our recent projects. For example, one day I'd try to get sprites done for the players then the next I'd work on the coins and boosters, and so on. 
I got stuck on a lot of things, the game I mentioned above was what I attempted but I ran into loads of bugs that delayed my work by hours so I thought to myself, "Perhaps simple is the key to this," so I continued on with the simple things and got to the extra stuff once 
I had more of a leeway. 
With the knowledge I have now, I would say I defenietly would attempt to get as close as possible to the original goal I had down on the game design document I had. I would say I didn't stray that far from my original game I had on my document but I somewhat did stray away
from the most important part which was having two colored coins for each player to collect. I think that would've defenietly made the game more competitive. I would I stayed on track mainly because of the goals I had set for each day. I would'nt go to bed until I was 100% confident in my work for the goal of the day.
